# Permissioned Blockchains

> Notes from the [monax.io article](https://monax.io/learn/permissioned_blockchains/) about  permissioned blockchains.

Permissioned blockchains do not differ from unpermissioned blockchains (public blockchains) except from the presence of an **access control layer** built into the blockchain nodes.
##### How to define whether it is a permissioned network or not ? 
\- Can anyone restrict who can participate in the consensus mechanism of the blockchain's network?
\- Can anyone restrict who has the ability to issue smart contracts or transact on the blockchain network?

## Benefits of permissioned blockchains :

 - Performance : one can get better performance from a single blockchain network by limiting what that network is actually trying

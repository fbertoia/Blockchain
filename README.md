# Permissioned Blockchains

> Notes from the [monax.io article](https://monax.io/learn/permissioned_blockchains/) about  permissioned blockchains.

Permissioned blockchains (PB) do not differ from Unpermissioned Blockchains (public blockchains) (UB)  except from the presence of an **access control layer** built into the blockchain nodes.
##### How to define whether it is a permissioned network or not ? 
\- Can anyone restrict who can participate in the consensus mechanism of the blockchain's network?
\- Can anyone restrict who has the ability to issue smart contracts or transact on the blockchain network?

## Benefits of permissioned blockchains :

 - ***Performance*** : one can get better performance from a single blockchain network, since the computation work will focus only on the application you try to use. No extra effort would be spend upon mining useless contracts.

- ***Governance clearly defined*** : innovation is slow to be adopted on UB because it requires consensus between major actors. Conversely, PB are very flexible, and also, may aim at fulfilling very specific objectives compared to UB which '*have to be built for the lowest common denominator*'. 

- ***PB are more cost efficient*** : PB ensure security on blockchain and avoid any attack vector. (Infinite loops can be handle in a different manner than relying upon pricing dynamics).

- ***Security*** :
